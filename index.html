    <h2 class='introduction' id='intro'>Introduction.</h2>
    <p>The first time I played Dungeons and Dragons was in the small dimly lit interior of the Twenty Sided Store in Brooklyn, NewYork. It was loud, voices clammoring over each
    other in an attempt to be heard. People were talking about their characters and what they thought the current season was going to be about. I approached the front clerk, nervous
    and ready to turn tail. The store owner snuck up on me with a knowing smile.</p>
    <p>She asked &quot; Are you new to the hobby?&quot; She knew the answer. I was not the first to have the wide deer in the headlights
    expression. She put a sheet of paper and a set of dice in my hand, ushered me to a table and left be at the mercy of my fellow players and Dungeon Master. The collective response was to
    think of a name. Everything else would fall into place. Thus Zahir You-Thievin'-Bastard was born, a one dimentional character who did nothing but drink, steal and wander around in confusion (You
    might notice certain similarities to my own state of being at the time).</p>
    <h2 class='what-is-dnd' id='what-is'>What is DnD?</h2>
    <p>At its core, Dungeons & Dragons is a group storytelling game.</p>

      <p>It is also known as tabletop <b>roleplaying</b> in which you play a <b>role</b> within a larger overarching story. We have all done this at some point in our lives. When you are practising for that job
        interview and you stand in front of a mirror, pretending you are speaking in front of your interviewer, working to present an image that gives you the best chance at getting hired. Well in the
        case of dungeons and dragons, you take on a less mundane and more fantastical role. One player prepares a story of adventure - be it fantasy, dystopian, slapstick etc - then the rest of the players
        take charge of characters in that story and gather together to cooperatively tell the tale.</p>

<p>D&D lends itself to a certain trope. Often times you take on the role of a character in a more medieval setting where there are knights, kings, queens, wizards and dragons a plenty.</p>
